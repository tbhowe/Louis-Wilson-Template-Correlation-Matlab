Hi Tim,
Sorry for the unconventional way of contacting you, but I thought I would try one last avenue... As you know, Matt and I have been trying to replicate the analyses you did on my ephys data to be able to send the manuscript back for review. So far we haven't had much luck, and I would really appreciate a meeting, if you can spare the time, to give us some pointers on where we're going wrong.
If there's something that either of us has done to offend you and you don't want to be involved in the project any more, just say so and we will omit your work altogether and submit it as a computational paper again. I don't want to come across like I'm harrassing you. But the last thing I heard was that you were still intending to collaborate, so I'm not sure why we haven't been able to get through by email (maybe you lost access to your email?).
You can contact me at roscowemma@gmail.com
I hope your projects and job are going well! I got laid off this summer (the startup I worked at went bust) so I'm looking for a new job at the moment.
Best wishes,
Emma
